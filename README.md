This repository is meant to give me a public, easily accessable backup of what I did in school. (If this causes me to somehow trigger a anticopy thingy, I will cry =( )  
**NOTE : html files should go inside /docs, as github pages is set up to view that folder**

Reminder : Git (and/or github) will only upload folders to github if there are files inside them. ~~Remember to modify from the laptop, if possible~~ Just remember to add dummy text files. They funny =)
