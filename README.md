Edit : new html repo at [nathannino/CAL-web](https://github.com/nathannino/CAL-web) and new private repo at [nathannino/CAL-A21-ver2](https://github.com/nathannino/CAL-A21-ver2)

# CAL-ver1
This repository is meant to give me a public, easily accessable backup of what I did in school. (If this causes me to somehow trigger a anticopy thingy, I will cry =( )  
**NOTE : html files should go inside /docs, as github pages is set up to view that folder**  

---
Reminder : Git (and/or github) will only upload folders to github if there are files inside them.  
~~Remember to modify from the laptop, if possible~~ Just remember to add dummy text files. They funny =)
